(** The type for watermarks. A watermark identifier, e.g. ["ID"] and its
    definition:
      {ul

      {- [`Name], is the name of package.}
      {- [`Version], is the version of the distribution.}
      {- [`Version_num], is the version of the distribution with a potential
         leading ['v'] or ['V'] dropped.}
      {- [`Vcs `Commit_id], is the commit identifier (hash) of the
         distribution. May be post-fixed by ["dirty"] in
         dev package ([`Pin]) builds.}
      {- [`Opam (file, field, sep)], is the values of the field
         [field] concatenated with separator [sep] of the opam file
         [file], expressed relative to the distribution root directory, if
         [file] is [None] this is the package's default opam file, see
         {!describe}. Not all fields are supported see the value of
         {!Opam.File.field_names}.}}

      When a file is watermarked with an identifier ["ID"], any occurence of
      the sequence [%%ID%%] in its content is substituted by its definition. *)
