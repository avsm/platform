Code coverage for OCaml

Bisect_ppx helps you test thoroughly. It is a small preprocessor that inserts
instrumentation at places in your code, such as if-then-else and match
expressions. After you run tests, Bisect_ppx gives a nice HTML report showing
which places were visited and which were missed.

Usage is simple - add package bisect_ppx when building tests, run your tests,
then run the Bisect_ppx report tool on the generated visitation files.
