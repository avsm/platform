## OCaml Platform 1.0 monorepo

This has been vendored using the [duniverse](https://github.com/avsm/duniverse)
tool and consists of the binaries that will form the first release of the OCaml
Platform.

This repository will be frequently rebased and is not suitable for anything
beyond experiments yet.
