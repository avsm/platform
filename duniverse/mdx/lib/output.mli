(** Test outputs. *)

type t = [`Output of string | `Ellipsis]
(** The type for test outputs. Ellipisis ([...]) allow to skip zero,
   one or many lines while comparing the outputs with {!equal}. *)

val equal: t list -> t list -> bool
(** [equal x y] is true iff [x] and [y] are equivalent, modulo
   ellipsis. *)

val merge: [`Output of string] list -> t list -> t list
(** [merge output test] merges any [`Ellipsis] items from [test] into
   [output]. *)

val pp: ?pad:int -> t Fmt.t
(** [pp] is the pretty-printer for test outputs. [pad] is the size of
   the optional whitespace left-padding (by default it is 0). *)

val dump: t Fmt.t
(** [dump] is the printer for dumping test outputs. Useful for debugging. *)
