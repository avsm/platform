(** [Mdx] is a library to manipulate markdown code blocks.

    [mdx] allows to execute code blocks inside markdown files. The
   supported code {{!Block}blocks} are either {{!Cram}cram-like}
   tests, raw OCaml fragments or {{!Toplevel}toplevel} phrases.

    Cram tests and toplevel phrases are sequences of commands and
   {{!Output}outputs}.  *)

module Toplevel = Toplevel

  | Normal
  | Cram

(** The type for the lines of a markdown or cram file. *)
type line =
  | Section of (int * string)
  | Text    of string
  | Block   of Block.t

val pp_line: ?syntax:syntax -> line Fmt.t
(** [pp_line] is the pretty-printer for markdown or cram lines. *)

(** {2 Document} *)

type t = line list
(** The type for mdx documents. *)

val pp: ?syntax:syntax -> t Fmt.t
(** [pp] is the pretty printer for mdx documents. Should be idempotent
   with {!of_string}. *)

val to_string: t -> string
(** [to_string t] converts the document [t] to a string. *)

val of_string: syntax -> string -> t
(** [of_string syntax s] is the document [t] such that
    [to_string ~syntax t = s]. *)

val parse_file: syntax -> string ->  t
(** [parse_file s] is {!of_string} of [s]'s contents. *)

val parse_lexbuf: syntax -> Lexing.lexbuf -> t
(** [parse_lexbuf l] is {!of_string} of [l]'s contents. *)

(** {2 Evaluation} *)

val run: ?syntax:syntax -> ?force_output:bool -> f:(string -> t -> string) -> string -> unit
(** [run ?syntax ~f n] runs the expect callback [f] over the file named
   [n]. [f] is called with the raw contents of [n] and its structured
   contents; it returns the new file contents. If the result of [f] is
   different from the initial contents or if force_output was set to true, then
   [$n.corrected] is created with the new contents. *)

(** {2 Filtering} *)

val section_of_line: line -> (int * string) option
(** [section_of_line l] is [l]'s section. *)

val filter_section: Re.re -> t -> t option
(** [section re t] is the subset of [t] such that their section
   matches with [re]. *)
