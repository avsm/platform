\section{Introduction}

Finding a graph library for one's favorite programming language is
usually easy. But applying the provided algorithms to one's own graph
data structure or building undirected persistent graphs with vertices
and edges labeled with data other than integers is likely to be more
difficult. Figure~\ref{comparison:tab} quickly compares several graph
libraries according to the following criteria: number of graph data
structures; purely applicative or imperative nature of the structures;
and ability to apply the provided algorithms to a user-defined graph
data structure.  As one can notice, none of these libraries gives full
satisfaction.  This paper introduces
\ocamlgraph\footnote{\url{http://www.lri.fr/~filliatr/ocamlgraph/}}, a
highly generic graph library for the programming language
\ocaml~\cite{ObjectiveCaml}, which intends to fulfill all these
criteria.

% Beside the mere presentation of this
% library, this paper demonstrates how \ocaml has been used to
\ocamlgraph\ introduces genericity at two levels. First, \ocamlgraph
does not provide a single data structure for graphs but many of them,
enumerating all possible variations (19 altogether)---directed or
undirected graphs, persistent or mutable data structures, user-defined
labels on vertices or edges, etc.---under a common interface.
Secondly, \ocamlgraph provides a large set of graph algorithms that
are written independently from the underlying graph data structure.
These can then be applied naturally to the data structures provided by
\ocamlgraph itself and also on user-defined data structures as soon as
these implement a minimal set of functionalities.

Without proper parameterization, such a large set of variants may
easily result in unmanageable code. We avoid this pitfall using the
\ocaml module system~\cite{leroy00}, which appears to be the tool of
choice for this kind of meta-programming.  The genericity of
\ocamlgraph is indeed achieved through a massive use of \ocaml
functors. On one hand, they are used to avoid code duplication between
the many variations of graph data structures, which is mandatory here
due to the high number of similar but different implementations.  On
the other hand, they are used to write graph algorithms independently
from the underlying graph data structure, with as much genericity as
possible while keeping efficiency in mind.

This paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{motivatingexample}
demonstrates the use of \ocamlgraph through an example.
Section~\ref{implementation} exposes the design of the common
interface for all graph data structures and explains how the code is
shared among various implementations.  Section~\ref{algos}
describes the algorithms provided in \ocamlgraph and how
genericity  is obtained with respect to the graph data structure.
Finally Section~\ref{bench} presents some benchmarks.

\section{Motivating Example}\label{motivatingexample}

To illustrate the use of \ocamlgraph, we consider a Sudoku solver
based on graph 
coloring.  The idea is to represent the Sudoku grid as an undirected
graph with $9\times 9$ vertices, each vertex being connected to all
other vertices on the same row, column and $3\times 3$ group.
Solving the Sudoku is equivalent to 9-coloring this graph.
Figure~\ref{fig:sudoku} displays the sketch of a solution to
this problem using \ocamlgraph\footnote{Full source code for the
  Sudoku example is given in appendix~\ref{appendix}.}. There are
four steps in this code:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We choose a graph data structure for our Sudoku solver: it is an
  imperative undirected graph with vertices labeled with pairs of
  integers (the cells coordinates) and unlabeled edges. 
  In this structure, vertices are also
  equipped with integer marks, that are used to store the assigned
  colors.
\item We create the Sudoku grid and fill it with the initial
  constraints.
\item We obtain a coloring algorithm for our graph data structure.
\item We solve the Sudoku problem by 9-coloring the graph.
\end{enumerate}
This code is almost as efficient as a hand-coded Sudoku solver: on the
average, a Sudoku puzzle is solved in 0.2 seconds (on a Pentium IV 2.4
GHz).  The remainder of this paper goes into more details about the
code above.

\begin{figure}[t]
\hrulefill\\[-2em]

\begin{ocaml}
module G = Imperative.Graph.Abstract
             (struct type t = int * int end) 

let g = G.create ()

let () = 
  ... add vertices to g with G.add_vertex,
      edges with G.add_edge and initial
      constraints (20 lines of code) ...

module C = Coloring(G)       

let () = C.coloring g 9
\end{ocaml}
\end{center}
\hrule

  \caption{A Sudoku solver using \ocamlgraph}
  \label{fig:sudoku}
\end{figure}
 


% What we should expect from a good graph library is thus:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item the ability to easily build an undirected graph where each
%   vertex is labeled with a pair of integers (the cell coordinates);
% \item an efficient graph coloring algorithm that can be applied to the
%   above data structure. 
% \end{enumerate}
% If a graph library is providing only directed graphs or only
% unlabeled vertices, one has to adapt to the existing data structure.
% Generally speaking, the user may want
% to choose any combination of the following features:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \emph{directed} or \emph{undirected} graphs;
% \item \emph{labeled} or \emph{unlabeled} vertices and edges;
% \item \emph{types} for the labels, when any;
% \item \emph{persistent} or \emph{imperative} data structure;
% \end{itemize}
% The strong point in \ocamlgraph is to provide \emph{all} possible
% combinations, as ML modules sharing a common signature \texttt{G}.
% Then algorithms are provided as ML functors whose arguments must have
% signatures compatible with \texttt{G}.

\section{Signatures and Graph Data Structures}\label{implementation}

Managing many variants of graph data structures without proper
parameterization results into unmanageable code.
%
Here we show how we factorized the \ocamlgraph implementation to avoid
such pitfall.  Section~\ref{interface} describes the common
sub-signatures shared by all graphs. Section~\ref{structuresdedonnees}
details their various implementations.

% First Section~\ref{interface} describes the common signatures for all
% graph data structures.  Then Section~\ref{structuresdedonnees} details
% the various graph implementations.

\subsection{Sharing Signatures for All Graphs}\label{interface}


All graph data structures share a common sub-signature \texttt{G} for
observers. Two other signatures distinguish the modifiers for
persistent and imperative graphs, respectively.

The common signature \texttt{G} includes an abstract type \texttt{t}
for the graph datatype and two modules \texttt{V} and \texttt{E} for
vertices and edges respectively. The signature for \texttt{E} always
includes a type \texttt{label} which is instantiated by the singleton
type \texttt{unit} for unlabeled graphs. Modules \texttt{V} and
\texttt{E} both implement the standard comparison and hashing
functions so that graph algorithms may easily construct data
structures containing vertices and edges.  \texttt{G} also includes
usual observers such as functions to iterate over vertices and edges,
which are massively used in graph algorithms.  The common signature
looks like:

%\newpage 

\begin{ocaml}
module type G = sig
  type t
  module V : sig type t ... end
  module E : sig
    type t 
    type label 
    val label : t -> label
    ...
  end
  val iter_vertex : (V.t -> unit) -> t -> unit
  val iter_succ : (V.t -> unit) -> t -> V.t -> unit
  ...
end
\end{ocaml}
We distinguish the signature \texttt{P} for persistent graphs
from the signature \texttt{I} for imperative graphs, since the modifiers do
not have the same type in both:
\begin{ocaml}
module type P = sig
  include G
  val empty : t
  val add_vertex : t -> V.t -> t
  val add_edge : t -> V.t -> V.t -> t
  ...
end
module type I = sig
  include G
  val create : unit -> t
  val add_vertex : t -> V.t -> unit
  val add_edge : t -> V.t -> V.t -> unit
  ...
end
\end{ocaml}

\subsection{19 Graph Data Structures in 1000 Lines of Code}\label{structuresdedonnees}

\ocamlgraph provides 19 graph data structures, which include all the
possible combinations of the following 4 criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{directed} or \emph{undirected} graph;
\item \emph{labeled} or \emph{unlabeled} edges;
\item \emph{persistent} or \emph{imperative} data structure;
\item \emph{concrete} or \emph{abstract} type for vertices.
\end{itemize}
The last point requires some explanations. Vertices are always labeled
internally with the value provided by the user. Accessing this value
depends on the choice of concrete or abstract vertices.  Concrete
vertices allow unrestricted access to their value.  Abstract vertices
hide their value inside an abstract data type.  The former allows a
more immediate use of the data structure and the latter a more
efficient implementation. In particular, imperative graphs with
abstract vertices can be equipped with integer mutable marks, which
are used in our Sudoku solver.

A functor is provided for each data structure. It is parameterized by
user types for vertex labels and possibly edge labels. These functors
are displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:interfaces} as square boxes mapping
signatures of input modules to the signature of the graph module.
Of these, 8 functors exist in both directed and undirected versions.
\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  %\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{interface.pdf}    
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{interface.eps} 
  \caption{\ocamlgraph data structures components}\label{fig:interfaces}
\end{figure*}
Input signatures \texttt{ANY\_TYPE}, \texttt{ORDERED\_TYPE\_DFT} and
\texttt{COMPARABLE} define the user types for vertices and edges
labels. Output signature \texttt{IM} extends signature \texttt{I} with
mutable marks. Three other implementations complete the set of graph
data structures, namely \texttt{ConcreteBidirectional} for graphs with
an efficient access to predecessors, and
\texttt{Matrix.}(\texttt{Graph}, \texttt{Digraph}) for graphs
implemented as adjacency matrices. For efficiency reasons, these three
implementations do not offer the same combination of criteria as the
previous ones.

Several functors are used internally to avoid code duplication among the
functors presented in Figure~\ref{fig:interfaces}. For instance, a
functor adds labels to 
unlabeled graphs; another one encapsulates concrete vertices into an
abstract data type; etc.  Putting it all together, the code size for
the 19 graph data structures is about 1000 lines. This is clearly
small enough to be easily maintained. In Section~\ref{bench} we will
show that this code is also quite efficient.

The graph data structure for our Sudoku solver is simply an imperative
undirected graph with abstract vertices labeled with pairs of integers
and unlabeled edges. It is obtained as:
\begin{ocaml}
module G = Imperative.Graph.Abstract
             (struct type t = int * int end) 
\end{ocaml}

\section{Generic Algorithms}\label{algos}

This section introduces the second use of functors in \ocamlgraph:
generic programming of graph algorithms.

\subsection{Decoupling Algorithms and Graph Data Structures}

As demonstrated in Section~\ref{implementation}, our library provides
many graph data structures. It makes it necessary to factorize the
code for graph algorithms that operate on these structures. Again,
functors provide a nice encoding of generic algorithms.

The basic idea when coding an algorithm is to focus only on the
required operations that this algorithm imposes on the graph data
structure. Then this algorithm can be expressed naturally as a functor
parameterized by these operations. These operations usually form a
subset of the operations provided by \ocamlgraph graph data
structures. In a few cases, the algorithm requires specific operations
that are independent of the graph data structure. In such a case, the
specific operations are provided as an additional functor parameter.

Such a ``functorization'' of algorithms has two benefits: first, it
allows to add quickly new algorithms to the library, without
duplicating code for all data structures; secondly, it allows the user to
apply an existing algorithm on his own graph data structure.

%% libraries.

\subsection{Example: Depth-First Traversal}
\label{dfs}

We illustrate the generic programming of graph algorithms on the
particular example of depth-first prefix traversal (DFS).  To implement DFS,
we need to iterate over the graph vertices and over the edges leaving
a given vertex. If we do not assume any kind of marks on vertices, we
also need to build a data structure to store the visited nodes. 
We choose a hash table for this purpose and thus we require a hash
function and an equality over vertices.
Thus the minimal input signature for the DFS functor is as follows:
\begin{ocaml}
module type G = sig
  type t
  module V : sig
    type t 
    val hash : t -> int 
    val equal : t -> t -> bool 
  end
  val iter_vertex : (V.t -> unit) -> t -> unit
  val iter_succ : (V.t -> unit) -> t -> V.t -> unit
end
\end{ocaml}
The DFS algorithm is then implemented as a functor with an argument of
signature \texttt{G}. The result of functor application is a module
providing a single function \texttt{dfs} to traverse a given graph
while applying a given function on all visited vertices:
\begin{ocaml}
module Dfs(G : G) : 
  sig val dfs : (G.V.t -> unit) -> G.t -> unit end
\end{ocaml}
To implement this functor, we first instantiate \ocaml's generic hash
tables on graph vertices:
\begin{ocaml}
module Dfs(G : G) = struct
  module H = Hashtbl.Make(G.V)
\end{ocaml}
Then we can implement the traversal. The following code uses a hash
table \texttt{h} to store the vertices already visited and an explicit
stack \texttt{stack} to store the vertices to be visited (to avoid the
possible stack overflow of a recursive implementation). Function
\texttt{G.iter\_vertex} is used to start a DFS on every vertex. The
DFS itself is performed in function \texttt{loop} using \texttt{G.iter\_succ}:
\begin{ocaml}
  let dfs f g = 
    let h = H.create 65537 in
    let stack = Stack.create () in
    let push v = 
      if not (H.mem h v) then 
      begin H.add h v (); Stack.push v stack end
    in
    let loop () =
      while not (Stack.is_empty stack) do
        let v = Stack.pop stack in
        f v;
        G.iter_succ push g v
      done
    in
    G.iter_vertex (fun v -> push v; loop ()) g
end
\end{ocaml}
Beside this simple algorithm, \ocamlgraph\ provides other kinds of
traversals (breadth-first, postfix, etc.) and more efficient
implementations when the graph data structure contains mutable marks
on vertices.

\subsection{Example: Graph Coloring}
\label{coloring}

As a second example, we present a graph coloring algorithm used in our
Sudoku solver.
For the purpose of our
algorithm, we require the presence of \texttt{get} and \texttt{set}
operations on integer marks associated to vertices. We use these marks
to store the color assigned to each vertex. We also need iterators
over vertices and successors. Thus the minimal signature for a graph
data structure used in our graph coloring algorithm is the following:
\begin{ocaml}
module type GM = sig
  type t
  module V : sig type t ... end
  module Mark : sig
    val get : V.t -> int
    val set : V.t -> int -> unit
  end
  val iter_vertex : (V.t -> unit) -> t -> unit
  val iter_succ : (V.t -> unit) -> t -> V.t -> unit
end
\end{ocaml}
\ocamlgraph already provides implementations for such a
signature. This is the case for the graph data structure used in our
Sudoku solver.
Then the graph coloring algorithm is implemented as the following functor:
\begin{ocaml}
module Coloring(G : GM) : sig
  val coloring : G.t -> int -> unit
end
\end{ocaml}
It provides a single function \texttt{coloring} which colors a given
graph with a given number of colors. Some marks may contain initial
constraints. 
To complete our Sudoku solver, we simply need to apply the above
functor on our graph module \texttt{G}:
\begin{alltt}
module C = Coloring(G)
\end{alltt}
If \texttt{g} contains the Sudoku graph, and
assuming that the initial constraints are set in \texttt{g} marks, 
solving the Sudoku amounts to 9-coloring graph \texttt{g}:
\begin{alltt}
C.coloring g 9
\end{alltt}


\section{Benchmarks}\label{bench}

Surprisingly, we could not find any standard benchmark for graph
libraries. In order to give an idea of \ocamlgraph efficiency, we
present here the results of a little benchmark of our own.  We test
four different data structures for undirected graphs with unlabeled
edges, that are either persistent (P) or imperative (I) and with
either abstract (A) or concrete (C) vertices. In the following, these
are referred to as PA, PC, IA and IC, respectively.  All tests were
performed on a Pentium 4 2.4 GHz.

We first test the efficiency of graph creation and mutation.  For that
purpose, we build cliques of $V$ vertices (and thus $E=V(V+1)/2$
edges since we include self loops).  Then we repeatedly delete all
edges and vertices in these graphs.  Figure~\ref{fig:bench:build}
displays the creation and deletion timings in seconds up to $V=1000$
(that is half a million edges).  The speed of creation observed is
roughly 100,000 edges per second for imperative graphs. The creation
of persistent graphs is slower but within a constant factor (less than
2). Deletion is twice as fast as creation.  Regarding memory
consumption, all four data structures use approximately 5 machine words
(typically 20 bytes) per edge.

  \caption{Benchmarking creation (top) and deletion (bottom)}
  \label{fig:bench:build}
\end{figure*}

Our second benchmark consists in building graphs corresponding to 2D
mazes using a percolation algorithm and traversing them using
depth-first and breadth-first traversals. Given an integer $N$, we
build a graph with $V=N^2$ vertices and $E=V-1$ edges.
Figure~\ref{fig:bench:maze} displays the timings in seconds for
various values of $N$ up to 600 (i.e. 360,000 vertices). The observed
speed is between 500,000 and 1 million traversed edges per second.

% \input{./bench2mem}

We also tested the adjacency matrix-based data structure. Creation and
deletion are much faster in that case, and the data structure for
a dense graph is usually much more compact (it is implemented using bit
vectors). However, the use of this particular implementation is
limited to unlabeled imperative graphs with integer vertices. 
The above benchmarks, on the contrary, do not depend on the nature of
vertices and edges types. Thus they are much more representative of
\ocamlgraph average performances.


\section{Conclusion}

We presented \ocamlgraph, a highly generic graph library for \ocaml\
providing several graph data structures and graph algorithms.
Algorithms are written independently from graph data structures, which
allows combining user data structure (resp. algorithm) with
\ocamlgraph algorithm (resp. data structure).  To our knowledge, there
is no library for any applicative language as generic as \ocamlgraph.
This genericity is obtained using \ocaml module system and especially
its functors which allow sharing large pieces of code and provide
greater consistency than the mere use of higher-order functions.  The
same level of genericity could probably be achieved using Haskell's
multi-parameter type classes~\cite{Dreyer2007,Wehr2005,Oleg}.
Regarding imperative 
languages, graph libraries are rarely as generic and never provide as
many different data structures.

Since its first release (Feb. 2004), the number of \ocamlgraph users
has been increasing steadily and several of them contributed code to the
library. Some of them provided new graph data structures (such as
\texttt{ConcreteBidirectional}) and others new algorithms
(e.g. minimal separators). It clearly shows the benefits of a generic
library where data structures and algorithms are separated.
