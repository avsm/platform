met to the satisfaction of the reviewers. If you are unable to achieve 
this the paper will be rejected. TFP 2007 received 33 submissions and we 
were only able to accept 10 for publication (including your own).

Attached you will find the comments from the reviewers. Please pay close 
attention to their comments as you prepare the camera-ready version of 
your article. Shortly, you will receive formatting instructions for the 
final version of your article.

Best regards,

Marco

Given the page limit, the paper could perhaps be extended to give even more=

There is something very strange about your references. I noticed that you h=
ave remarkably few citations within=20
your text (with the exception of Fig 1). When I looked closer, I found that=
 close to half of your references=20
(8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 18) are never actually cited anywhere in your paper=
! I'm guessing that these citations=20
were edited out somewhere along the line, and you never re-ran bibtex.=20

I'm surprised that your Imperative.Graph.Abstract graphs appear to have *in=
teger* marks built-in, given that=20
applications that need boolean marks or floating-point marks are common. Is=
 there a functor in your system that=20
lets choose different types of marks? It is worth a sentence or two explain=
ing about the default treatment of=20
marks. (More on this point: on page 5, you say "*can* be equipped" rather t=
han "are equipped", which implies=20
that there is a choice, but I don't see in appendix A where this choice is =
exercised.)=20

It would also be worth adding an appendix or a table listing the various fu=
nctors supported in your library,=20
with just a short sentence for each.=20

I don't understand the last column in Fig 1. I assume a check means "has ge=
neric algorithms", and a 0 means=20
"does not have", but I don't know what the dash means.=20

Please add a citation on page 9 where you say "percolation algorithm". I'm =
not familiar with this term.

The paper presents a generic graph library which provides many different gr=
aph data structures and typical graph=20
algorithms. The genericity is achieved using the OCAML module system and ML=
 functors.=20

This work is worth publishing, the results are impressive, but the paper ne=
eds much more explanation of the OCAML=20
module system, ML functors, and their support for generic programming.=20

In the conclusions, you state that your approach provides greater consisten=
cy than the mere use of higher-order=20
functions. Please elaborate on this point.=20

You state that the modifiers for imperative and persistent graphs have diff=
erent types. How can you then type=20
the generic algorithms using these modifiers? Do you require the types of t=
he modifiers to be in a subtype relation?=20

How can you ensure that the generic graph algorithms work correctly for the=
 user's own graph structures. How do=20
you specify side-conditions that the user's graph implementation should res=
pect?=20

I would like to see the generic coloring routine.=20

In Figure 3m, you used a too small font size, a looking glass is needed to =
read the boxes. This figure should be=20
explained in more detail. Comment on the subtyping and functor application =
relations.
