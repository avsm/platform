### Dependencies

Dose3 needs ocaml >= 3.11.2 . On debian, dose3 **does not compile** on debian lenny.
 
Required libraries ( DEBIAN / RPM ) :

* libextlib-ocaml-dev / ocaml-extlib-devel
* libre-ocaml-dev / ??
* camlp4
 
Additional libraries (enable compilation with --with-<library>) :

* libpostgresql-ocaml-dev / ocaml-postgresql-devel
* libsqlite3-ocaml-dev / ocaml-sqlite-devel
* libzip-ocaml-dev / ?
* libbz2-ocaml-dev and libbz2-dev / ?
* libjson-static-camlp4-dev / ?
* libocamlgraph-ocaml-dev / ?
* libounit-ocaml-dev / ocaml-ounit-devel
* librpm-dev / librpm-devel
* libexpat-ocaml-dev (for --with-xml)
* libbenchmark-ocaml-dev (for --with-benchmark)
 
To use rpm support, dose3 needs librpm > 4.6
To use ocamlgraph support, dose3 needs libocamlgraph-ocaml-dev >= 1.8.4

### Compile
 
To compile dose without any additional libraries :
```
$aclocal -I m4
$autoconf
$./configure
$make
```

the configure script accepts many optional arguments to enable different features :
  
* --with-rpm4
* --with-rpm5
* --with-xml
* --with-ocamlgraph
* --with-parmap
* --with-zip
* --with-bz2
* --with-oUnit
* --with-curl
 
[[libcudf|cudf]] is included in the source tree of dose3 available by git but
not in the dose3 release tarball. By default dose3 uses the system wide version
of libcudf. To use the version of libcudf in the source tree you can specify
--without-libcudf as configure option. If using an independently installed
version of libcudf you'll need version >= 0.6.2.

#### Example:
```
./configure --with-ocamlgraph --with-zip --with-bz2
```

### Building the documentation

"make doc" builds the documentation. For this it is necessary to have
configured with option --with-ocamlgraph. You also need to have
installed "graphviz".

### Install
```
$./configure --prefix=/path/to/
$make
$make install
```

By default dose is installed in /usr/local/{lib,bin} . In this case root privileges 
might be needed to install the library. Dose also ships a META file compatible with
ocamlfind.
