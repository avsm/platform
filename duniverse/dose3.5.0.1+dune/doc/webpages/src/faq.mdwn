### Not all source packages are considered by dose-builddebcheck
```
% dose-builddebcheck --deb-native-arch=amd64 --dump=cudf Packages.bz2 Sources.bz2
native-architecture: amd64
background-packages: 55890
foreground-packages: 18109
broken-packages: 60
```
However, the file Source.bz2 contains more source packages than that:

% grep -c ^Package: Sources
18375

That means that 266 source stanzas have not been taken into account.

These packages were ignored because they have an architecture different from
amd64. In the invocation above the target distribution is amd64 and therefore
packages, for example, that should be compiled on armel only are ignored.
Adding -v -v will show you the list of packages that are ignored.
