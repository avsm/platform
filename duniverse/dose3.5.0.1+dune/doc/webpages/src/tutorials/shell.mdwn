Exit codes allow for a convenient integration of installation checks as tests in
shell scripts.

Example: Suppose that you want to check installability of all .deb files in
the current directory with respect to the repository unstable.packages before
uploading your package described in mypackage.changes:

    find . -name "*.deb" -exec dpkg-deb --info ’{}’ control \; -exec echo ""\; | \
    dose-debcheck --bg unstable.packages && dput mypackage.changes
