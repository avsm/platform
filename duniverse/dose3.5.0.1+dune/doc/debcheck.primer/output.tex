\section{Output}
\label{sec:output}
The output of \debcheck{} is in the YAML format, see
Section~\ref{sec:tricks-python} for how to parse the output.

Without any particular options, \debcheck{} just reports some
statistics:
\begin{example}
\begin{verbatim}
% dose-debcheck rep1
background-packages: 0
foreground-packages: 4
total-packages: 4
broken-packages: 1
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

With the options \texttt{--failures} and \texttt{--successes}, \debcheck{}
reports findings of the requested kind for all packages in the foreground.
These options may be used alone or in combination. In any case, the status
field tells whether the package is found to be installable (value \texttt{ok})
or non-installable (value \texttt{broken}).

\begin{example}
\begin{verbatim}
% dose-debcheck --failures --successes rep1
report:
 -
  package: a
  version: 1
  architecture: amd64
  source: a (= 1)
  status: broken
  
 -
  package: a
  version: 2
  architecture: amd64
  source: a (= 2)
  status: ok
  
 -
  package: b
  version: 1
  architecture: amd64
  source: b (= 1)
  status: ok
  
 -
  package: c
  version: 3
  architecture: amd64
  source: c (= 3)
  status: ok
  
 
background-packages: 0
foreground-packages: 4
total-packages: 4
broken-packages: 1
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

With an additional \texttt{--explain} option, an explanation is given
with each finding. 

\subsection{Understanding Explanations of Installability}

An explanation of installability simply consists of an
installation set in the sense of Section~\ref{sec:installability}
containing the package in question.

\begin{example}
\begin{verbatim}
% dose-debcheck --explain --successes rep1
report:
 -
  package: a
  version: 2
  architecture: amd64
  source: a (= 2)
  status: ok
  installationset:
   -
    package: c
    version: 3
    architecture: amd64
   -
    package: a
    version: 2
    architecture: amd64
 -
  package: b
  version: 1
  architecture: amd64
  source: b (= 1)
  status: ok
  installationset:
   -
    package: b
    version: 1
    architecture: amd64
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

An installation set contains all essential packages (see
Section~\ref{sec:installability}), which may blow up the output of
installability. Giving the option \texttt{--deb-ignore-essential} will
avoid this, but will also alter the notion of installability in some
corner cases (for instance, when a package needs a version of an
essential package that is not available in the repository).

\subsection{Understanding Explanations of Non-installability}

Installability of a package is much easier to explain than
non-installability. The reason for this is that in the former case we
just have to give one installation that our tool has found, while in
the latter case we have to explain why \emph{all} possible attempts to
install the package must fail. The first consequence of this
observation is that the explanation in case of non-installability may
consist of several components.

\begin{example}
  Consider the following repository consisting of only two packages:
\begin{verbatim}
Package: a
Version: 1
Depends: b | c

Package: c
Version: 3
Conflicts: a
\end{verbatim}
To explain why package (\texttt{a},1) is not installable we have to
say why all possible alternative ways to satisfy its dependency must
fail:
\begin{itemize}
\item there is no package \texttt{b} in the repository
\item the only version of package \texttt{c} in the repository is in
  conflict with package (\texttt{a},1)
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

There may be several ways to satisfy dependencies due to alternatives
in the dependencies in packages. Alternatives may occur in dependencies
in different forms:
\begin{itemize}
\item explicitly, like in \texttt{Depends: b|c},
\item through dependency on a package that exists in several versions,
\item through dependency on a virtual package which is provided by several
  (possibly versions of) real packages.
\end{itemize}
There is one component in the explanation for every possible way to
choose among these alternatives in the dependencies.

There are only two possible reasons why an attempt to satisfy dependencies
may fail:
\begin{enumerate}
\item dependency on a package that is missing from the repository,
\item dependency on a package that is in conflict with some other package
  we depend on (possibly through a chain of dependencies).
\end{enumerate}
Each component of the explanation is either a missing package, or a conflict. 

\subsubsection{Explanation in Case of a Missing Package}
A component of the explanation that corresponds to the case of a
missing package consist of two stanzas:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \texttt{pkg} stanza that states the package that cannot satisfy
  one of its direct dependencies
\item a \texttt{depchains} stanza containing the dependency chain that
  leads from the package we have found non-installable to the one that
  cannot satisfy its direct dependency.
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
An explanation might look like this:
\begin{verbatim}
package: libgnuradio-dev
version: 3.2.2.dfsg-1
architecture: all
source: gnuradio (= 3.2.2.dfsg-1)
status: broken
reasons:
   -
    missing:
     pkg:
      package: libgruel0
      version: 3.2.2.dfsg-1+b1
      architecture: amd64
      unsat-dependency: libboost-thread1.40.0 (>= 1.40.0-1)
     depchains:
      -
       depchain:
        -
         package: libgnuradio-dev
         version: 3.2.2.dfsg-1
         Architecture: all
         Depends: libgnuradio (= 3.2.2.dfsg-1)
        -
         package: libgnuradio
         ersion: 3.2.2.dfsg-1
         architecture: all
         depends: libgnuradio-core0
        -
         package: libgnuradio-core0
         version: 3.2.2.dfsg-1+b1
         architecture: amd64
         depends: libgruel0 (= 3.2.2.dfsg-1+b1)
\end{verbatim}
This tells us that \texttt{libgnuradio-dev} in version $3.2.2.dfsg-1$
is not installable, due to the fact that package \texttt{libgruel0}
in version $3.2.2.dfsg-1+b1$ has a dependency
\texttt{libboost-thread1.40.0 (>= 1.40.0-1)} that is not matched by
any package in the repository. The dependency chain tells why package
\texttt{libgnuradio-dev} in the given version might want to install
\texttt{libgruel0}.
\end{example}

The depchains component gives all possible dependency chains (\textit{depchains}, for short) from the root package
(\texttt{libgnuradio-dev} in the above example) to the one where a
direct dependency is not matched by any package (\texttt{libgruel0} in
the example). We do not include the last node in the dependency chain
to avoid a useless repetition.

In general there may be more then one path to reach a certain package
from a given root package, in that case \debcheck{} will unroll all of
them.
\begin{example}
In the following repository, package \texttt{a} is not installable since 
the dependency of package \texttt{d} cannot be satisfied:
\begin{verbatim}
Package: a
Architecture: amd64
Version: 1
Depends: b|c

Package: b
Architecture: amd64
Version: 1
Depends: d

Package: c
Architecture: amd64
Version: 3
Depends: d

Package: d
Architecture: amd64
Version: 42
Depends: x
\end{verbatim}
There are two different ways how \texttt{a} arrives at a dependency on
\texttt{d}. \debcheck{} reports the problem once, but lists the two paths 
from \texttt{a} to \texttt{d}:
\begin{verbatim}
% dose-debcheck -e -f --checkonly a rep1
report:
 -
  package: a
  version: 1
  architecture: amd64
  source: a (= 1)
  status: broken
  reasons:
   -
    missing:
     pkg:
      package: d
      version: 42
      architecture: amd64
      unsat-dependency: x
     depchains:
      -
       depchain:
        -
         package: a
         version: 1
         architecture: amd64
         depends: b | c
        -
         package: b
         version: 1
         architecture: amd64
         depends: d
      -
       depchain:
        -
         package: a
         version: 1
         architecture: amd64
         depends: b | c
        -
         package: c
         version: 3
         architecture: amd64
         depends: d
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}


\subsubsection{Explanation in Case of a Conflict}
The other possible cause of a problem is a conflict. In that case, the
explanation consists of a \texttt{conflict} stanza giving the two
packages that are in direct conflict with each other. Next, we have
two \texttt{depchain} stanzas that lead to the first, resp. the second
of these directly conflicting packages.
\begin{example}
\begin{verbatim}
package: a
  version: 1
  status: broken
  reasons:
   -
    conflict:
     pkg1:
      package: e
      version: 1
     pkg2:
      package: f
      version: 1
     depchain1:
      -
       depchain:
        -
         package: a
         version: 1
         depends: b
        -
         package: b
         version: 1
         depends: e
     depchain2:
      -
       depchain:
        -
         package: a
         version: 1
         depends: d
        -
         package: d
         version: 1
         depends: f
\end{verbatim}
The first part of the \debcheck{} report is as before with details
about the broken package. Since this is a conflict, and all conflicts
are binary, we give the two packages involved in the conflict
first. Packages \texttt{f} and \texttt{e} are in conflict, but they
are not direct dependencies of package \texttt{a} . For this reason,
we output the two paths that from a lead to \texttt{f} or
\texttt{e}. All dependency chains for each conflict are
together. Again, since there might be more than one way from a to
reach the conflicting packages, we can have more then one depchain.
\end{example}
If a conflict occurs between two packages that are both reached
through non-trivial dependency chains then we sometimes speak of a
\emph{deep conflict}.

\subsection{The output in case of co-installability queries}
In case of a co-installability query (with the option
\texttt{--coinst}), the distinction between background and foreground
does no longer make sense since the checks now apply to tuples of packages,
and not to individual packages. As a consequence, the summary looks a bit
different in this case:

\begin{example}
  In the following example, there are 3 different versions of package
  \texttt{aa}, two different versions of package \texttt{bb} and two
  packages with other names, giving rise to 6 pairs of packages to
  check for co-installability. Two pairs out of these 6 are found
  not co-installable:
\begin{verbatim}
% ./debcheck --coinst "aa,bb" coinst.packages 
total-packages: 7
total-tuples: 6
broken-tuples: 2
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

Listings of co-installable, or non co-installable packages when
requested with the options \texttt{-s}/\texttt{--successes},
resp.\ \texttt{-f}/\texttt{--failures}, are similar as before but now
start on the word \texttt{coinst} instead of \texttt{package}. Explanations
are as before:

\begin{example}
\begin{verbatim}
% ./debcheck --coinst "aa,bb" -s -f -e coinst.simple
report:
 -
  coinst: aa (= 2) , bb (= 11)
  status: ok
  installationset:
   -
    package: aa
    version: 2
    architecture: all
   -
    package: bb
    version: 11
    architecture: all
   -
    package: cc
    version: 31
    architecture: all
 -
  coinst: aa (= 1) , bb (= 11)
  status: broken
  
 reasons:
  -
   conflict:
    pkg1:
     package: aa
     version: 1
     architecture: all
     source: aa (= 1)
     unsat-conflict: cc
    pkg2:
     package: cc
     version: 31
     architecture: all
     source: cc (= 31)
    depchain2:
     
  -
   conflict:
    pkg1:
     package: aa
     version: 1
     architecture: all
     source: aa (= 1)
     unsat-conflict: cc
    pkg2:
     package: cc
     version: 31
     architecture: all
     source: cc (= 31)
    depchain1:
     
    depchain2:
     -
      depchain:
       -
        package: bb
        version: 11
        architecture: all
        depends: cc
  
 
total-packages: 5
total-tuples: 2
broken-tuples: 1
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}
