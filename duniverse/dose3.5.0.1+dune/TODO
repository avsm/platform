- add test cases for format822 (fielnames in particular)

- add --deb-output822 to DistcheckOptions to output 822 package list
  for distcheck, buildcheck etc of installable packages

- make apt-cudf output explanations when a request is not satisfiable,
  in the same style as what dose-distcheck does, if possible (beware
  of apt string mangling)

- fix common/EdosSolver documentation. For some reason only part of it is
  actually generated

- add minisat backend to the depsolver
** minisat ocaml bindings are now avalaible

- add picosat backend to the depsolver
** picosat ocaml bindings are now avalaible

-------------------

- add unit tests for opam and pef module
DONE

- Remove all references to Format in diagnostic.ml and all applications.
  Format is too slow !
NOT DONE : the new formar module is now as fast as Printf

- use ocaml-magic to identify compressed file types
DONE! not using ocaml magic, but reading directly the file header.
thanks josh !

- remove all references to Str and move to Pcre
DONE ! removed Pcre in favour of libre

- make all error codes gt 63 reserved for distcheck
** DONE !

- add --coinst to debcheck
** DONE !

- modify all test cases to check if the test file exists. If this is 
  the case, run the test, if not ignore the test. (this is to prepare
  a small release tarball with a restricted number of unit tests)

** Won't Fix : this is not importan anymore now that all test data 
   is in a separate repository

- make reason in depsolver lazy. This way we can save a bit of time 
  when building the sat problem

- find a way to add a proper (debian/rpm/real) version to missing 
  dependencies. atm this information is lost when traslating the 
  problem to cudf
** DONE !

- fix the broken dependencies explanation list. The reason list
  sometimes does not include broken packages at the end of a reason
  list. The solver does not provide this information. Actually this is 
  a problem with distcheck.
** DONE !

- when init the depsolver, create a new data structure where all dependencies
  and conflicts are explicit. Then use this data structure when iterate
  over packages. This way we can perform all lookups once and forall.
** DONE

- implement a debdistcheck that builds the sat problem directly from 
  debian Packages without passing through cudf and friends
** WONTFIX

- fix ocamlbuild to imply -DHASRPM only when using c_use_rpm in _tags
  and remove -I rpm when building debian binaries / -I deb when building
  rpm binaries
