(** Mapping (in the form of associative list) from stanza postmarks to type
    declarations.

    Keys in the map are usually only those prescribed by the CUDF
    specification, namely "preamble", "package", and "request". Values in the
    map are type declarations for each supported property of that stanza;
    usually they only represent core property schemata (see CUDF ยง2.2.3).

(** Default stanza types for parsing CUDF documents.

    For what concerns package stanzas, available types can be extended by using
    "property" declaration in the preamble stanza.
