libCUDF - CUDF (Common Upgradeability Description Format) library
=================================================================

libCUDF is a library to manipulate so called CUDF documents. A CUDF
(Common Upgradeability Description Format) document describes an
"upgrade scenario", as faced by package managers in popular
package-based FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) distributions.

A CUDF document consists of an optional leading "preamble", a "package
universe", and a trailing "user request":

- The package universe describes all packages known to the package
  manager, a subset of which (the "package status") denotes the
  package being currently installed on a given machine.

- The user request denotes a change to the package status requested by
  the user, e.g.: "install package foo", "remove package bar", ...

- The preamble contains meta-information such as a typing information
  for custom package properties, checksums, document unique
  identifiers, ...

A CUDF document is naturally complemented by a "solution" describing
the resulting package status (if any) that satisfies the user request,
as found by a package manager.

libCUDF enables manipulation of CUDF and related documents.


Development
-----------

Development happens on the INRIA Forge, in the [cudf project][1]. There you can
find:

* [releases][4]
* [Git repository][5]
* [bug reports][6]

[1]: https://gforge.inria.fr/projects/cudf/
[4]: https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/?group_id=4385
[5]: https://gforge.inria.fr/scm/?group_id=4385
[6]: https://gforge.inria.fr/tracker/?group_id=4385

Please report bugs using the forge [bug tracker][6] rather than mailing me
directly.

If you're in a hurry and just want to get the latest version of the code, here
is the command you're looking for:

    $ git clone https://gforge.inria.fr/git/cudf/cudf.git
