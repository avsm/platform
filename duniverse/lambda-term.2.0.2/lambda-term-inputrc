# Read-line only key bindings

[edit]

# General key bindings

# Each line is of the form:
#
#   <input sequence>: <actions>
#
# where <input sequence> is a list of keys in emacs style. For example
# to bind Control+w to cut the word before the cursor, write:
#
# C-w: kill-prev-word
#
# <actions> may contains several action. For example, to insert
# "Hello, world!" when pressing Control+h, write:
#
# C-h: insert(H), insert(e), insert(l), insert(l), insert(o), insert(,), insert( ), insert(w), insert(o), insert(r), insert(l), insert(d), insert(!)
#
# Note that in keys and actions, lambda-term recognize only ascii
# character, if you want to use non-ascii ones, you must write them
# U+<hexa code>. For example to bind Control+é to inserting "É",
# write:
#
# C-U+e9: insert(U+c9)
#
# For a list of possible actions, run the command
# "lambda-term-actions".
#
# This file is divided in sections, and each section refer to a
# particular set of key bindings. There is two sections: [edit] and
# [read-line]. The [edit] section is for key bindings that apply
# everywhere, and the [read-line] section is for key bindings that
# apply only in read-line.
