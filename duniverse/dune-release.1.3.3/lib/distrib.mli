      In the following the {e distribution build directory} is a

      [dune-release distrib] is invoked.

         before archiving. It can be used to
         generate distribution time build artefacts. Defaults to {!massage}.}

         directory, after massaging, to determine the paths that are
         excluded from being added to the distribution archive. Defaults to
         {!exclude_paths}.}} *)

    function. It is invoked in the distribution build directory and
    does nothing. *)

(** [default_exclude_paths ()] is the default list of paths to exclude
    from the distribution archive. It is invoked in the distribution build
