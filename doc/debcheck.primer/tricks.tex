\section{Tips and Tricks}
\label{sec:tricks}
\subsection{Encoding checks involving several packages}
\debcheck{} only tests whether any package in the foreground set is
installable. However, sometimes one is interested in knowing whether
several packages are co-installable, that is whether there exists an
installation set that contains all these packages. One might also be
interested in an installation that does \emph{not} contain a certain
package.

This can be encoded by creating a pseudo-package that
represents the query. 

\begin{example}
  We wish to know whether it is possible to install at the same time
  \texttt{a} and \texttt{b}, the latter in some version $\geq 42$, but
  without installing c. We create a pseudo package like this:
\begin{verbatim}
Package: query
Version: 1
Architecture: all
Depends: a, b(>= 42)
Conflicts: c
\end{verbatim}
Then we check for installability of that package with respect to the
repository:
\begin{verbatim}
echo "Package: query\nVersion: 1\nArchitecture: all\nDepends: a, b(>=42)\nConflicts: c" | dose-debcheck --bg=repository
\end{verbatim}
(Beware: This might not do exactly what you want, see below!)
\end{example}

The problem with this encoding is as follows: if we ask \debcheck{}
for installability of some package depending on \texttt{a} then this
dependency can a priori be satisfied by any of the available versions
of package \texttt{a}, or even by some other package that provides
\texttt{a} as a virtual package. Virtual packages can be excluded by
exploiting the fact that, in Debian, virtual packages are not
versioned. As a consequence, any package relation (like Depends)
containing a version constraint can only be matched by a real package,
and not by a virtual package. This means that the dependency on
\texttt{b (>= 42)} in the above example already can only be matched by
a real package. If we also want to restrict dependency on \texttt{a}
to real packages only without knowing its possible versions, then we
may write \texttt{Depends: a (>=0) | a(<0)}.

\begin{example}
  If we wish to know whether it is possible to install at the same
  time some version of package \texttt{a} and some version of package
  \texttt{b}, under the condition that these are real packages and not
  virtual packages, then we may construct the following pseudo-package
  and check its installability:
\begin{verbatim}
Package: query
Version: 1
Architecture: all
Depends: a(>=0) | a(<0), b(>=0) | b(<0)
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

Note that it is in theory possible, though admittedly quite unlikely,
that a package has a version number smaller than $0$ (example:
$0\sim$).

However, if we have several versions of package \texttt{a} and several
versions of package \texttt{b} then the above pseudo-package is
installable if it is possible to install at the same time \emph{some
  version} of \texttt{a} and \emph{some version} of \texttt{b}. If we
want instead to check co-installability of any combination of versions
of package \texttt{a} with versions of package \texttt{b} then the
\texttt{--coinst} option (see Section~\ref{sec:invocation-coinst}) is
better suited for the task.

\subsection{Parsing \debcheck's output in Python}
\label{sec:tricks-python}
Debcheck's output can be easily parsed from a Python program by using
the YAML parser (needs the Debian package \texttt{python-yaml}).

\begin{example}
  If you have run debcheck with the option \texttt{-f} (and possibly
  with the \texttt{-s} option in addition) you may obtain a report
  containing one non-installable package (name and version) per line
  like this:
  
\begin{verbatim}
import yaml

doc = yaml.load(file('output-of-distcheck', 'r'))
if doc['report'] is not None:
  for p in doc['report']:
    if p['status'] == 'broken':
      print '%s %s is broken' (p['package'], p['version'])
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}

A complete example of a python script that constructs a set of
pseudo-packages, runs \debcheck{} on it, and then processes the output
is given in the directory
\texttt{doc/examples/potential-file-overwrites}.

\subsection{Usage as a test in a shell script}
Exit codes allow for a convenient integration of installation checks
as tests in shell scripts.

\begin{example}
Suppose that you want to check installability of all \verb|.deb| files
in the current directory with respect to the repository
\verb|unstable.packages| before uploading your package described in
\verb|mypackage.changes|:

\begin{verbatim}
find . -name "*.deb" -exec dpkg-deb --info '{}' control \; -exec echo ""\; | \
  dose-debcheck --bg unstable.packages && dput mypackage.changes
\end{verbatim}
\end{example}
