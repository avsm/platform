(** The base class. The parameter is the initial resource class. The
    resource class is the first part of all resource keys used by the

    For examples, buttons use the resources
    ["button.focused.foreground"], ["button.unfocused.bold"], ... so
    their resource class is ["button"].

(* Automatic configuration of the scrollbar.

  will be shown at the bottom of the viewable area using

 lowlevel interface for controlling how mouse events are translated
 to scroll offsets ([set_mouse_mode]) and the size of the scrollbar 
 ([set_scroll_bar_mode]).

 [scrollable_document] provides a higher level interface for 
 configuring the operation of the scrollbar where the scrollbar
 is used to reflect the area of a page within a potentially larger
 document.

 [scrollbar_private] is an internal interface between the [scrollable]
 object and a [scrollbar] used to exchange parameters needed to
 perform rendering. *)

   bottom to up, but only the topmost layer gets keyboard events delivered to

     stdout, loading resources from [.lambda-termrc], saving state and
     restoring it on exit from ui.
     Example: [do_run my_frame]

     [push_layer w] where w is a widget is a callback to add w as a new modal
     layer to UI.

     [pop_layer] is a callback to destroy the topmost modal layer.
     Example: [cancel_button#on_click pop_layer].

     [exit] is a callback to exit the UI.
     Example: [exit_button#on_click exit]
