(* About focus; widgets may specify an optional target widget in each direction.  
   The focus specification is intepreted in two ways based on can_focus.

   can_focus=true

      If the currently focussed widget has a focus specification in the required
      direction that widget is jumped to.  Otherwise a search is performed.

   can_focus=false

      Widgets with can_focus=false will never be the current focus, however, 
      they can take part in search for a widget.  When we search over such
      a widget, if it has an appropriate focus specification then we jump
      there.
