       dune-release - How to release a (dune) package

DESCRIPTION
       The basic release script is the following. Each step is refined and
       explained with more details below.

       dune-release browse issues # Review remaining outstanding issues
       dune-release status        # Review the changes since last version

       dune-release publish       # Publish it on the WWW with its documentation
       dune-release opam pkg      # Create an opam package
       dune-release opam submit   # Submit it to OCaml's opam repository

### Important Notes

Most of the code in this repository has been written and has already
been released part of the [topkg](http://erratique.ch/software/topkg)
tool.

The main differences between `dune-release` and `topkg` are:

- Remove `pkg/pkg.ml`;
- Assume the project is built with [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune);
- Bundle everything as a single binary;
- Use of `Astring`, `Logs`, `Fpath` and`Bos`;
- Remove the IPC layer (which is used between `topkg` and `topkg-care`);
- Remove the delegation mechanism: only publishing to GitHub is supported.
