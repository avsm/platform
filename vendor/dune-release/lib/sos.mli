(** Safe OS operations.

   All the commands in that module can have side-effects. They also
   all take a [--dry-run] paramater which cause the side-effect to be
   discarded and to display a message instead. Some of these commands
   also have a `[--force]` option: this causes the message to be
   printed AND the side-effects to be caused.  *)
