[Merlin](https://ocaml.github.io/merlin/) is an editor service that provides modern IDE features for OCaml.

Emacs and Vim support is provided out-of-the-box. External contributors added support for Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text and Atom.

Easy installation with Opam
===========================

If you have a working [Opam](https://opam.ocaml.org/) installation, Merlin is only two commands away:

```shell
opam install merlin
opam user-setup install
```

[opam-user-setup](https://github.com/OCamlPro/opam-user-setup) takes care of configuring Emacs and Vim to make best use of your current install.

You can also [configure the editor](#editor-setup) yourself, if you prefer.

Manually building and installing Merlin
=======================================

Compilation
-----------

Dependencies: ocaml >= 4.02.3, ocamlfind, yojson, dune.

```shell
dune build
```

Installation
------------

If you haven't encountered any errors in the previous step, just run:

    $ dune install

You can pass an explicit prefix to dune, using `--prefix`. It defaults to
your current opam switch.

Editor setup
============

To setup Emacs and Vim, you need to instruct them to run the appropriate script when an OCaml file is opened.

In the rest of the document, \<SHARE\_DIR\> refers to the directory where Merlin data files are installed.

It will usually be:  
- printed by the command `opam config var share`, if you used opam  
- "\<prefix\>/share" if you explicitly specified a prefix when configuring Merlin

### Vim setup

Makes sure that ocamlmerlin binary can be found in PATH.

The only setup needed is to have the following directory in vim runtime path (append this to your .vimrc):

    :set rtp+=<SHARE_DIR>/merlin/vim

The default configuration can be seen in:

    <SHARE_DIR>/merlin/vim/plugin/merlin.vim

After adding merlin to vim runtime path, you will probably want to run `:helptags <SHARE_DIR>/merlin/vim/doc` to register Merlin documentation inside vim.

A more comprehensive documentation can be found on the [vim-from-scratch wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/vim-from-scratch).

### Emacs setup

Merlin comes with an emacs library (file: emacs/merlin.el) that implements a minor-mode that is supposed to be used on top of tuareg-mode.

All you need to do is add the following to your .emacs:

```emacs
(push "<SHARE_DIR>/emacs/site-lisp" load-path) ; directory containing merlin.el
(setq merlin-command "<BIN_DIR>/ocamlmerlin")  ; needed only if ocamlmerlin not already in your PATH
(autoload 'merlin-mode "merlin" "Merlin mode" t)
(add-hook 'tuareg-mode-hook 'merlin-mode)
(add-hook 'caml-mode-hook 'merlin-mode)
```

`merlin-mode` will make use of `auto-complete-mode` (available by package.el and the MELPA repository) if it is installed.

A more comprehensive documentation can be found on the [emacs-from-scratch wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/emacs-from-scratch).

### Other editors

The wiki also contains pages for:  
- [Acme](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/acme-from-scratch)  
- [Atom](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/atom-from-scratch)  
- [Spacemacs](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/spacemacs-from-scratch)

External contributors have implemented modes for more editors:  
* [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/hackwaly/vscode-ocaml)  
* [Sublime Text 3](https://github.com/cynddl/sublime-text-merlin)  
* [ocaml-merlin package for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/ocaml-merlin)  
* [nuclide for Atom](https://nuclide.io/) includes Merlin support

Next steps
==========

To use Merlin with a multi-file project, it is necessary to have a [.merlin](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki/project-configuration) file.

Read more in the [wiki](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin/wiki) to learn how to make full use of Merlin in your projects.

Development of Merlin
=====================
 
Most of the development happens through the [github page](https://github.com/ocaml/merlin).

The [mailing list](https://lists.forge.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/merlin-discuss) welcomes general questions and discussions.

Merlin needs your help and contributions!

### Reporting Issues

When you encounter an issue, please report it with as much detail as possible. A thorough bug report is always appreciated :)

Check that our issue database doesn't already include that problem/suggestion. You can click "subscribe" on issues to follow their progress and updates.

When reporting issues, please include:  
- steps to reproduce the problem, if possible with some code triggering the issue,  
- version of the tools you are using: operating system, editor, OCaml.

Try to be as specific as possible:  
- avoid generic phrasing such as "doesn't work", explain why it is not working (editor is freezing, you got an error message, the answer is not what was expected, ...)  
- include the content of error messages.

If it seems relevant, also include information about your development environment:  
- the Opam version and switch in use,  
- other toolchains involved (OCaml flavors, cygwin, C compiler, shell, ...),  
- how the editor was setup.

### Pull Requests

Found a bug and know how to fix it? Or have a feature you can implement directly? We appreciate pull requests to improve Merlin, and any significant fix should start life as an issue first.

### Documentation and wiki

Help is greatly appreciated, the wiki needs love.

If the wiki didn't cover a topic and you found out the answer, updating the page or pointing out the issue will be very useful for future users.

### Discussing with other Merlin users and contributors

Together with commenting on issues with direct feedback and relevant information, we use the [mailing list](https://lists.forge.ocamlcore.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/merlin-discuss) to discuss ideas and current designs/implementations. User input helps us to converge on solutions, especially those for aesthetic and user-oriented topics.
