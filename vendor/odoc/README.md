# odoc

**odoc** is a documentation generator for OCaml. It reads *doc comments*,
delimited with `(** ... *)`, and outputs HTML. See example output at
[docs.mirage.io][mirage-docs].

[mirage-docs]: http://docs.mirage.io/

Text inside doc comments is marked up in ocamldoc syntax:

```ocaml
val compare : string -> string -> int
(** [compare s1 s2] compares [s1] and [s2] in {e lexicographic} order. The
    result is negative if [s1] precedes [s2], positive if [s1] follows [s2],
    and zero if [s1] and [s2] are equal. *)
```

The syntax reference is [here][comment-syntax]. There is also an
[explanation][comment-location] of how to attach comments to specific types,
values, and other elements in your program.

odoc's main advantage over ocamldoc is an accurate cross-referencer, which
handles the complexity of the OCaml module system. odoc also offers a good
opportunity to improve HTML output compared to ocamldoc, but this is very much
a work in progress :)

## Installing and usage

```
opam install odoc
```

The easiest way to use odoc right now is by having Dune (Jbuilder) drive it.
This command should work in most Jbuilder projects out of the box:

```
jbuilder build @doc
```

The generated docs can then be found locally at
`./_build/default/_doc/_html/index.html`.
