To build
========

Build dependencies:
- ocaml	>= 3.10.2	(Debian package: "ocaml-nox", RPM: "ocaml")
- findlib		(Debian package: "ocaml-findlib", RPM: "ocaml-findlib")
- extlib		(Debian package: "libextlib-ocaml-dev",
  			 RPM: "ocaml-extlib-devel")
- oUnit			(only needed to run the test suite
  		 	 Debian package: "libounit-ocaml-dev",
			 RPM: "ocaml-ounit-devel")
- glib			(only needed to build the C bindings
			 Debian package: "libglib2.0-dev",
			 RPM: "libglib2.0-devel")
- perl                  (for pod2man, to build cudf-check.1 man page)

To build run:

  $ make all	# build bytecode libs and executables
  $ make opt	# build native code libs and executables (if you have ocamlopt)
  $ make test	# run the test suite (need oUnit)


C bindings
----------

To build the C bindings to the OCaml library run:

  $ make -C c-lib		# build C bindings (to OCaml bytecode)
  $ make -C c-lib-opt		# build C bindings (to OCaml native code)
  $ make -C c-lib test		# run the test suite for C bindings


To install
==========

To install run, after compilation:

  # make install	# install libs and executables

To install under a non-standard location, say "/my/dest/dir":

  $ make install DESTDIR=/my/dest/dir


To uninstall

  # make uninstall

or:

  $ make uninstall DESTDIR=/my/dest/dir
