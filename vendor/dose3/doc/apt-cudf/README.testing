# To test the apt-cudf behaviour in the apt toolchain,
# 1) dump in EDSP the state of the repositories
apt-get -s --solver dump install gnome
# it is in /tmp/dump.edsp

# 2) dump the CUDF translation of the EDSP file
./apt-cudf.native --dump --solver aspcud --noop /tmp/dump.edsp 

# it is stored in a file in /tmp/ whose name is shown in stdout
# something like /tmp/apt-cudf-universedd360b.cudf
# and /tmp/dump.edsp
